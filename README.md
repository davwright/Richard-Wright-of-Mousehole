*Richard Wright, a plain humble fisherman from the west of Cornwall, who had been received on trial into the Methodist Itinerancy the preceding year, offered likewise to go, that as a Gospel-fisher he might catch me. The Conference Minutes say, @Our brethren in America call aloud for help. Who are willing to go over and help them? Five were willing. The two appointed were Francis Asbury and Richard Wright*
