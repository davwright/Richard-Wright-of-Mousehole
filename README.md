# Richard Wright of Mousehole (1743-1804)
Richard Wright was one of two missionaries that [John Wesley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley) sent to [British America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_America) in 1771 a *humble gospel-fisher that he might catch men*. His companion was the famous [Francis Asbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Asbury), *the Father of American Wesleyism*.

## Mousehole
Mousehole is a picturesque fishing village in the South West corner of Cornwall only 15 km from Land's End.
Cornwall was a rebellious place, it did not like being controlled from faraway London. Cornwall had provided tin for thousands of years and sheep in modern times. 
The [Cornish Rebellion of 1497](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_Rebellion_of_1497) was about taxes raised to fight Scotland.  
Cornwall and Devon [revolted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_Book_Rebellion) in 1549 against the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, partially because it was in the English language. The Spanish took note of this, thinking the Cornish might ally with them against the protestant English. 
During the [Raid on Mounts Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Mount%27s_Bay) Spanish galleys bombarded Mousehole on 2 August 1595 damaging all but one house and killing 3. A second group of Spaniards moved inland and sacked Paul, desotroying the [St Pol de Léon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pol_de_L%C3%A9on%27s_Church,_Paul)  church along with all church records. Inhabitants of Mousehole were christened, married and buried in Paul - all early family records come from this church, until the first "modern" [United Kingdom census of 1841](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1841_United_Kingdom_census)

## Ancestry
Richard Wright's ancestry can be traced back 5 generations to the Mousehole fisherman Martin Wright (1580-1620), who lived through the Spanish raid of 1595. Martin had a son John, followed by 3 generations of Martins, until Richard is born, the younger brother of Martin and John.

## John Wesley (1703 - 1791) in Mousehole
John Wesley preached at Land's End 17-18 Sept 1743 and returned in 1757. (Wesleys in Cornwall, page 93). On 25 August 1785, aged 82, he walked "down the rocks to the very edge of the water".
Wesley preaches to 23,000 at [Gwenap pit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwennap), Cornwall, September 1, 1781.   He preached there 18 times betweeh 1762 and 1789.  
John Harvey lead a Methodist society in his house in Mousehole


## George Whitfield in America 7 times during 1738-1770
George Whitfield traveled from Georgia to New England in 1738 and visited America 7 times until his death in 1770. He *formed no socieities of his own, but left his converts to the care of the ordinary pastors.. \[but\] the leaven of Calvinism soon destroying fair fruits; while it is remarkable that the same work in England, under Mr. Wesley, assisted by **young and illiterate lay-preachers**, guided by a differenst system of doctrine and discipline, constantly flourished.* (page 290, Query)  
John Wesley focuses attention on America after the death of George Whitfield.

## 1766 
The first Methodist society is founded in New York, in 1768 the built the first Methodist church there. (A Review, page 133).At the same time societies are formed in Maryland and Philadelphia.  
Joseph Pilmoor "accepts full admission to the itinerancy" on the Cornwall East Circuit. he was earlier there on trial [https://www.francisasburytriptych.com/book-series/characters/joseph-pilmoor/]

## 1769 Methodist Conference Leeds
*We have a pressing call from our brethren at New-York, who have built a preaching-house, to come over and help them. Who was willing to go? **Richard Boardman** and **Joseph Pilmoor**. what can we do further, in token of our brotherly love? Let us now make a collection among ourselves. This was immediately done, and out of it £50 were alloted towards the payment of their debt; and about £20 given to the brethren for their passage.* \[Compendium 194]
Pilmoor itinerated in Cornwall and Wales before going to America. (https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/pilmore-joseph-or)
*In 1769 Richard Boardman (New York) and Joseph Pillmoor (Philadelphia) came to the assistance of the infant societies [in America]. These were the first regular travelling ministers on the continent. They meeting with much success, and being able to report great openings for the spread of the gospel in America, in 1771 Francis Asbury and Richard Wright were sent over. Before this, the work had been principally confined to the cities; but Mr. Asbury, per that the country people more readily received the truth than those in the cities, led the way into the towns, villages, and sparsely populated places in the interior, in which he met with anticipated success; and it may justly be remarked that, to this day [1838]* [page 291, Review 20]
## Methodist Itinerancy 1770
Richard *had been received on trial into the Methodist Itinerancy*

## 28th Methodist Conference 7 August 1771, Bristol
*At the conference it was proposed that some preachers should go over to the American Continent* [page 46, Asbury Journal]  
*I returned to Bristol in the latter end of August, where Richard Wright was waiting for me" [page 47, Journal]  
* Mr. Wesley published his "Thoughts on Public Affairs"
* Mr. Shirley and his friends came to project against the propositions.
* Mr. Jospeh Benson admitted on trial
* Messrs. Asbury and Wright sent to America.
\[page 313, Review]  
*Richard Wright, a plain humble fisherman from the west of Cornwall, who had been received on trial into the Methodist Itinerancy the preceding year, offered likewise to go, that as a Gospel-fisher he might catch men. The Conference Minutes say, @Our brethren in America call aloud for help. Who are willing to go over and help them? Five were willing. The two appointed were Francis Asbury and Richard Wright*

## In British America 1771
*Richard Wright had served one year as an itinerant before he came to America. He preached in Pennsylvnia, New York, Delaware and Maryland, and returned to England in 1774. He was appointed to West Cornwall for two years, after which his name disappears from the **Minutes**. He did not succeed in America because, according to Asbury, he "was spoiled by gifts" and "he had not taste for spiritual subjects." (Asbury Journal May 29, 1774); This was also the judgment of Thomas Rankin, as stated in his Journal, now at Garret Bible Institute, page 101* [Journal Asbury page 124]

## 1772

##Wed 14 - Fri 16 July 1773 . The First American Methodist Conference, Philadelphia
10 preachers attended: Thomas Rankin, Richard Boardman, Joseph Pilmoor, Francis Asbury, Richard Wright, George Shadfield, Thomas Webb, John King, Abraham Whitworth, and Jospeh Yearbry.
*Rankin says there were 7 preachers, besides Boardman and Pilmoor, who were to return to England...* [Episcopal,  page160] 

*There were now 10 preachers  and 1,160 members in the societies. At this time American preachers were reaised up and called into the work* \[Page 292, Vol20\]

*Soon after this, Messrs. Boardman and Pillmoor were recalled, and in 1773 Thomas Rankin and George Shadford were sent in their places. Mr Rankin was endowed with certain disciplinary powers for the regulation of the societies by Mr Wesley, as none others possessed before him. Of this there was much need, for before this discipline was almost wholly neglected, and many persons were connected with the societies who were not heartily attached to Methodism, of which things Mr. Asbury very much complains before this. These men were made a very great blessing to the people - Mr. Rankin, as a superintendent, in introducing discipline was almost wholly neglected, and many persons were connected with the societies who were not heartily attached to Methodism, of which things Mr. Asbury very much complains before this."* (page 292, The Methodist Query, Vol 20)

## 1774
*17 preachers and 2,073 members* (page 292, The Methodist Query, Vol 20)  
Richard Wright returned to England with Joseph Yerbury [Rankin Journal, 81] in "early 1774" [Episcopal page 172] *He labored chiefly in Maryland and Virginia, though there is evidence that he spent part of 1772 in New York City" (refering to Wakely, chapter 24)*

## 9 May 1774
*Wright had been successfully at work, meanwhile, in Virgina, and ont he 9th of May, 1774, on his return, he cheered Asbury with good news. "Mr. Wright," he says, "arrived today from Virginia. He gave us a circumstantial account of the work of God in thos eparts. One house of worship is built, and another in contemplation; two or three more preachers are gone out upon the itinerant plan; and in some parts the congreations consist of two or three thousand people. But some evlidminded persons have opposed the action of toleration, and threatened to improsion him. May the Lord turn their hearts and make them partakers of his great salvation!" The first church here mentioned became famous in after years as Yeargon's Chapel," the first Methodist ediface in Virginia;
## 1775
*As the leading preachers were Englishmen, and avowedly attached to the interests of the mother country, they all left the country before the close of 1778, except Mr Asbury, who, being ardently attached to the infant socieites, now deserted by their chief shepherds, resolved to remain with them through those troublous times.* (page 292, Query)  
*Martin Rodda and James Dempster were sent over; but the success of these men was not as great as could have been desired. They soon returned to England. \[...\] Mr Wesley's plan was to send two preachers every two years, which continued till eight were sent, and then the war \[of Independence\] prevented more* (Page 202, Query, Vol 20)

## Circuit Preacher in Cornwall
The footnotes to Asbury's diary say Wright was in Cornwall after US for 3 years "before he disappears from the minutes" - which means he's mentioned in the Methodist minutes from 1774 to 1777.

## Marriage and Family

Prudence Johns

## Descendents

* Martin Wright (1780-1854), married Elizabeth Harvey, daughter of Alexander and Margaret Harvery. Alexander was the son of John Harvey and Elizabeth Over, who ran the Mousehole Methodist Society. *The name Harvey was passed down through the Wright family for 8 generations to Donald Harvey Wright (1927-2014)*
* Joseph Wright (1808-1853), married Arabella Rowse and emigrated to South Australia in November 1836 after George Fife Angas personally recruited him in the King's Arms Inn, Portsmouth, as he was looking for "pious fishermen" for South Australia. Joseph & Arabella arrived at Kingscote in April 1837 on the "South Australian", as head of fisheries for the South Australian company, paid £110/year. With him came the 3 Germain brothers - the 4 of them together were a seine net fishing team. George Fife Angas intended to make Kingscote the "Singapore of the South", which failed due to lack of drinking water. Jospeh Wright wrote a letter of complaint to Angas in London in October 1837 about his condition and Kingscote was abandoned by 1839, by which time Joseph and Arabella were living in a tent in Alberton, Port Adelaide. The wreck of the "The South Australian" was [re-discovered](https://www.victorharbortimes.com.au/story/5509462/sas-oldest-shipwreck-found-off-encounter-bay/) in July 2018 at Rosetta Bay, the Bluff, Victor Harbour, after sinking there on 8 December 1837 during a storm. David McLaren's journal from the ship mentions that a hole was cut in the deck of the ship so that air could enter the cabin of Arabella Wright - future work on the wreck could identify the location of this cabin.  
* Peter Harvey Wright (1839-1916), born in a tent. Vet, shoemaker, Port Adelaide politician and itinerant methodist lay preacher.
* Charles Joseph Harvey Wright (1864-1941), lawyer in Port Adelaide. farmer in Mid North.
* Norman Harvey Wright (1894-1974), Methodist missionary to Fiji from 1926 to 1956.
* Harlan Wright (1942-), 8th generation Methodist, missionary to Philippines and Singapore.

### Richard Wright, Unitarian Preacher, 1815
 visited Mousehole in the 1815 (A Review, page 398) 
He describes 500 listening in Newlyn sitting on grass, sand and rocks, many of them fishermen (never did I see a congregation more deeply affected than this was) and Mousehole to 250 "who listened attentively to a discourse on the love of God"

## Notes
There were 100 Wrights in Mousehole in 1851 http://www.mygenealogies.co.uk/Wright/WRIG-SUM.htm
