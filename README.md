## 1769 America
*In 1769 Richard Boardman and Joseph Pillmoor came to the assistance of the infant societies [in America]. These were the first regular travelling ministers on the continent. They meeting with much success, and being able to report great openings for the spread of the gospel in America, in 1771 Francis Asbury and Richard Wright were sent over. Before this, the work had been principally confined to the cities; but Mr. Asbury, per that the country people more readily received the truth than those in the cities, led the way into the towns, villages, and sparsely populated places in the interior, in which he met with anticipated success; and it may justly be remarked that, to this day [1838]* [page 291, The Methodist Magazine and Quarterly Review, Volume 20](https://books.google.at/books?id=GpEeAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA290&lpg=PA290&dq=Methodist+Conference+1771&source=bl&ots=JoOA9ZMozj&sig=ACfU3U1nhx_A2Ui5ePlafSxWe1CucrX7ig&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjOx6j_zfLoAhWkmIsKHf0fBh0Q6AEwBXoECAkQQQ#v=onepage&q&f=false)

*Richard Wright, a plain humble fisherman from the west of Cornwall, who had been received on trial into the Methodist Itinerancy the preceding year, offered likewise to go, that as a Gospel-fisher he might catch me. The Conference Minutes say, @Our brethren in America call aloud for help. Who are willing to go over and help them? Five were willing. The two appointed were Francis Asbury and Richard Wright*

 John Wesley did not mention Richard in his letters between 1771-1775 http://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/the-letters-of-john-wesley/wesleys-letters-1775/

## 1773
*Soon after this, Messrs. Boardman and Pillmoor were recalled, and in 1773 Thomas Rankin and George Shadford were sent in their places. Mr Rankin was endowed with certain disciplinary powers for the regulation of the societies by Mr Wesley, as none others possessed before him. Of this there was much need, for before this discipline was almost wholly neglected, and many persons were connected with the societies who were not heartily attached to Methodism, of which things Mr. Asbury very much complains before this. These men were made a very great blessing to the people - Mr. Rankin, as a superintendent, in introducing discipline was almost wholly neglected, and many persons were connected with the societies who were not heartily attached to Methodism, of which things Mr. Asbury very much complains before this."* (page 292, The Methodist Qurery, Vol 20)
